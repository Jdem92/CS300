Questions answered for Module 8 Journal - 

Q: What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
A: he primary challenge I encountered in the projects for this course was reaching a 'debuggable' state in my code. Once I was able to step through the various methods and processes within each project, I found the material much easier to comprehend. This allowed me to engage with the code more effectively and gain a deeper understanding of its functionality. As this was my first real experience with C++, acclimating to the debugging process was initially a learning curve, but it ultimately enhanced my ability to work with the code.

Q: How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
A: Once I had properly configured my IDE and streamlined my setup, each project progressed smoothly. In terms of applying data structures, I gained a clear understanding of their significant benefits, particularly in contexts such as networking, distributed systems, and similar fields. The experience of reading data from a CSV file and utilizing it across various data structures allowed me to appreciate the versatility and distinct problem-solving approaches they offer.

Q: How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
A: From an overcoming roadblocks perspective I can only say that just working through errors and utilizing the C++ documentation was pretty helpful. 

Q: How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
A: I think from a design perspective, work in this class has encouraged me to really define logic before moving forward with implementation (designing pseudocode, then implementing). 

Q: How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
A: I think that I've always tried my best to put a lot of thought and effort in my approach to the way I write programs, through implementing the projects in CS300 I've gained another appreciation for emphasizing clear structure, modular design and efficient error handling (defensive programming I like to think). By focusing on seperating concerns and following best practices, I believe that I've developed a more disciplined approach to writing code.
